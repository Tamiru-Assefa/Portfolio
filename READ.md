### 🔔 Unique Feature – Telegram Bot Notification

One of the standout features of this website is the **Contact Me** section:

* When a visitor submits the contact form, **you get instantly notified on Telegram**.
* This is made possible by:

  * Creating a **Telegram Bot** via [BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots#botfather)
  * Using the **Telegram Bot API** to send messages to my chat
  * Sending form data with **JavaScript Fetch API**

This integration allows me to receive messages in real-time, directly on my phone through Telegram.

```

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Form Submission**

   * Users fill out the contact form with their name, email, subject, and message.

2. **JavaScript Integration**

   * The `script.js` file captures the form submission event and sends the data using `fetch()`.

3. **Telegram Bot API**

   * The JS code sends a request to the Telegram Bot API endpoint:

     ```
     https://api.telegram.org/bot<YOUR_BOT_TOKEN>/sendMessage
     ```
   * The message is delivered to my Telegram chat ID instantly.

> ⚠️ Note: The actual bot token and chat ID are stored securely and are not exposed in public repositories.
